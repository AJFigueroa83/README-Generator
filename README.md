# ReadMe Generator

## Description

ðŸ”Ž This is a readme.md markdown generator. It is a simple to use application that uses node js to run. When running it prompts the user for some key information to help the user generate a readme file faster. The running program will ask questions like: "What is the project name?", "What is it's purpose?", among others. The line of questions follows the guidelines in the *Professional README Guide*.

## Installation

ðŸ’¾ This program runs with the *inquirer package* which has to be installed prior to running. 

## Purpose

This program sets itself to shorten the amount of time necessary to produce a good README for your applications. By asking the key questions, it eliminates the guesswork or research on what are the neccesary sections on a good readme. The user just has to answer the questions when prompted and the program will generate a README ready for use.
